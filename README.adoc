== Getting Started with Spring Cloud Stream
This guide walks you through an overview of Spring Cloud Stream and the process of creating an event-driven
streaming application.

=== What is Spring Cloud Stream?
A framework for building event-driven Spring Boot microservices for real-time stream processing. You can learn more about
the framework from the link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream[project-site],
link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-stream#learn[documentation],
and link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-samples[samples].

=== Stream Processing with RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka
In the following guide, we develop three Spring Boot applications that use Spring Cloud Stream's support for RabbitMQ and Apache Kafka and deploy them to Cloud Foundry, to Kubernetes, and on your local machine.
You can use the toggle on the UI docs to switch between RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.

== Summary
Congratulations! You have completed Spring Cloud Stream's high-level overview, and you were able to build and test
Spring Cloud Stream applications that communicate with RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.
